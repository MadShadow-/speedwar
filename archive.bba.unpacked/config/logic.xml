        than the max distance, the entity will move towards a point that is the
        move distance away from the guarded entity.
          Another note: when a non-building entity is inside a building (e.g. a
        worker), the building is guarded instead, including changing the max
        and move distance, so guards may "hang back" a little.
          Of course, move and max distance as upper and lower threshold to avoid
        constant adjustment are less important for buildings, since buildings
        have a tendency to stay in one place :)  However, it can have influence
        when the guards were drawn away during battle.

        done per turn (!), the value should be divisible by ten to be accurate.  A value that
        is less than ten will be the same as zero (no slippage) very high slippage means that
        you'd really have to resurrect the hero in one go, because any benefits from other
        friends wear off immediately.
        The example value of 100 means that one second (1000ms) wears of in 10 seconds of the
        hero being alone again (i.e. 10% rate).

 Relative means a purchase will increase the current price as follows:
